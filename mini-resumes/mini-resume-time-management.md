# Mini Resume - Time Management

Every week, I've done **all** the activities on time and watched **all** of the lectures, as shown below.

My class has not been assigned any lecture notes yet, but I've been practicing by making short summaries of them (which may have been useful to those who were writing the notes -- perhaps it jogged their memory).

### Lecture Notes

#### Lecture 6: Two Big Ideas

* Learned about #define, which replaces every time an identifier is used with a constant (and screws with compiler warnings :( )

#### Lecture 7: Functions

* Random functions aren't functions
* What to break the doomsday assignment in to: year % 4 for leaps, %100 for not and then % 400 for adding again. The dooms day shifts one each year. 7/11, 11/7, 9/5, 5/9 are dooms days along side the nth of the nth month.

### Lecture Notes

#### Lecture 8: Doomsday

* How to write a function declaration

#### Lecture 9: Binary, Hex, and Decimal

* How hexadecimal works.
* To split up forum posts in to one for each question
* Do we have a forum? 

#### Lecture 10: Memory and Types

* The different types of data: char // int, long, short, float, double
* Learned that types can be signed, unsigned, etc.
* Booleans don't really exist in C.

#### Lecture 11: Importance

* Don't procrastinate (easier said than done)
* The first assignment will feel harder than it will when I'm done

#### Lecture 12: Functions (part 1)

* You should write 'void' in arguments if you expect nothing
* If no type is before a function name, C assumes it's int
* "I don't like floats" ==> don't use floats.
* We don't like side effects

## Week 4 (No link as it is not fully done -- Will be published later this week)

### Lecture Notes


#### Lecture 13: Functions (part 2)

* Compartmentalise as much as possible

#### Lecture 14: Bitmap Images

* You can use Wikipedia for finding the file structure of a BMP file
* 24 bit images == 8 bits of [red, green, blue].

#### Lecture 15: Addresses &pointers

* & gives the address of a pointer
* \* gives the item inside a pointer
* You can #include a local header file using `#include "file.h"`
* `scanf` et al. have side effects -- this is bad.

#### Lecture 16: Testing

* To test, `void test{functionName} (void)`
* Do a bunch of assertions: `assert (functionName(inp) == expectedOutput)`


I have also been managing school well at the same time. Perhaps for the real resume I may include a sample calendar of my week?
