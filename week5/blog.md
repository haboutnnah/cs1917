This week, my blog will shorter than normal because I was at [a UN Youth event](https://unyouth.org.au/event/nswconference/) (anyone else from HS go? anyone going to any other ones?). I think I want to do International Relations at uni now -- I want to do *so much* at uni -- Comp Sci specialising in Security, Med specialising in endocrinology, and now International Relations. 

I feel like it will be *interesting* to make the choice later/

I also went to the Climate Strike on Friday, which was neat. It was nice to meet some like-minded people and I caught up with some friends I haven't seen since primary school. I think I also saw Kaya there. Did many people from HS go?

## Teamwork

I helped Nikhil on the 'Explore Memory' assignment:

Jordan and I worked on his IPT assignment, which was interesting as I haven't worked with complex python (classes etc) in a long time, so it was nice to remember that.

We also worked on C swap function, where the `gcc` error messages were cryptic, so we went to `clang`, which gave us circular issues (put a star here, remove the star). It was a bit frustrating but made sense afterwards. I think assembly has a better pointer notation: `%pointer` is just the pointer but `[pointer]` is the contents inside.

We then worked on ROT13, which we did through a loop that adds one each time. We considered compartmentalising it in to a function, but it seemed to be relatively simple and didn't need to be broken up.

Later, we tried to do the diamond activity in our tutorial:

> Make a program that draws a triangle of side length *n*:
> 
     ./diamond 3
        \*
       \* \*
      \*   \*
       \* \*
        \*

I made one in Python, I'll migrate it to C soon.

## Time Management

I finished all assignments and lectures on time. We haven't got any lecture notes yet.

I could not watch next week's stuff and do the activities yet, because I was at a UN Youth event (as mentioned earlier).

## Something Awesome

I did nothing regarding my Something Awesome this week.

## Craftsmanship

For `swap.c`, I think it's an interesting approach. On one hand, it reduces lines of code, but it also has side effects. Perhaps (once we learn arrays), we can make the function return an array of the inputs but reversed, which would do similar things but with no side effects.
