Sydney trains, as "usual" decided to cancel the train I normally would catch to Hornsby, so I walked there instead and met with some friends until about 2:45pm and then went to Hornsby Girls.

Regarding last week's questions, I still don't know if this course is for me, given my "dragon" (below). Conversely, the fact that I can do this is indicative of how perfectly I fit in to this course. To be fair, the instructions _could_ be misread if you try very very hard.

Obviously, I fixed the arriving the 3pm issue.

x86 assembly still seems like a bit of a stretch. I will cover this more in the *Something Awesome* section of this post.

The most annoying assignment was the *Iffy Question* one because the code seemed to have no pattern or reasoning. I learned about the c function `AtoI`, equivalent to other languages' `parseInt`, or `int` casting, in an attempt to make bruteforcing questions 1 and 2 more quick:

## Teamwork

In the tutorial in Hornsby today, we did some pair programming. 

My lab partner was Jordan. First we programmed a program that works out if a number we get from the user is a leap year or not. After this, we compartmentalised the leap year logic in to a function. 

We also had to write test cases, which was weird but makes sense afterwards:

Hopefully soon we can automate the testing, perhaps using assert?

## Time Management

I was confused last week -- I was 2 lectures behind. I caught up now, though.

### Lecture Notes

#### Lecture 8: Doomsday

* How to write a function declaration

#### Lecture 9: Binary, Hex, and Decimal

* How hexadecimal works.
* To split up forum posts in to one for each question
* Do we have a forum? 

#### Lecture 10: Memory and Types

* The different types of data: char // int, long, short, float, double
* Learned that types can be signed, unsigned, etc.
* Booleans don't really exist in C.

#### Lecture 11: Importance

* Don't procrastinate (easier said than done)
* The first assignment will feel harder than it will when I'm done

#### Lecture 12: Functions (part 1)

* You should write 'void' in arguments if you expect nothing
* If no type is before a function name, C assumes it's int
* "I don't like floats" ==> don't use floats.
* We don't like side effects

## Something Awesome

## Craftsmanship

I can't say I did a lot of craftsmanship this week. In the pair programming, we wrote the function in a structured manner, where normally I would have just returned from the function directly. We also didn't have any side effects of the function:

Also, I'd like to thank Zac for showing me Carbon, which produces vector "screenshots" of code that I have used in this code
